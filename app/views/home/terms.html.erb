			<h2 class="nm-terms--section-header">BILLING</h2>
			<div class="nm-terms--section-item">
				Call times for each call are rounded up to the next whole minute and billed in full minute increments. Per call charges are rounded up to the next whole penny. All calls for which we receive answer supervision shall incur a minimum one-minute charge. Nimatel relies on answer supervision to determine whether and when a call has been answered. Answer supervision is a signal sent by the carrier connecting the call to indicate the start of call. Answer supervision is generally received when a call is answered; however, answer supervision may also be generated by voicemail systems, private branch exchanges, and interexchange switching equipment. Where no answer supervision is received, we will commence billing forty (40) seconds following dial time unless the caller has terminated the call. You must notify us in writing of any disputed charges within sixty (60) days of the charges or you will have waived your right to dispute the charges.
